I am an ecologist & data scientist from Canberra, Australia. I lead the Science & Decision Support Team at the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au). Previously, I was a Research Fellow in biodiversity science at the [Fenner School of Environment & Society](https://fennerschool.anu.edu.au), ANU.

I am a former winner of the [ESA Next Generation Ecologist Award](https://www.ecolsoc.org.au/wiley-next-generation-ecologist-award-past-winners/), and was part of the team that won the Australian Museum's [Eureka Prize for Applied Environmental Research](https://australian.museum/get-involved/eureka-prizes/eureka-prizes-archive/2022-eureka-prize-winners/) in 2022. More recently, my team won joint first place in the 2025 [Ebbe Nielsen Challenge](https://www.gbif.org/news/2LugQxJfG2kCzjiJocXzVZ/winners-from-norway-and-australia-share-first-place-in-the-2025-ebbe-nielsen-challenge), and I was awarded a [Churchill Fellowship](https://www.churchilltrust.com.au/fellow/martin-westgate-act-2025/) to address [challenges in biodiversity informatics](https://www.churchilltrust.com.au/project/to-investigate-global-scale-solutions-in-biodiversity-informatics/).
