### Description
Ecological Metadata Language or 'EML' is a long-established format for describing ecological datasets to facilitate sharing and re-use. Because 'EML' is effectively a modified 'xml' schema, however, it is challenging to write and manipulate for non-expert users. 'delma' supports users to write metadata statements in 'R Markdown' or 'Quarto markdown' format, and parse them to 'EML' and (optionally) back again.
