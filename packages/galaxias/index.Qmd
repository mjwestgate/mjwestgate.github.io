### Description
The Darwin Core data standard is widely used to share biodiversity information, most notably by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and its partner nodes; but converting data to this standard can be tricky. 'galaxias' is functionally similar to 'devtools', but with a focus on building Darwin Core Archives rather than R packages, enabling data to be shared and re-used with relative ease. For details see Wieczorek and colleagues (2012) <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0029715>.
