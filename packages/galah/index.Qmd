The Global Biodiversity Information Facility  ([GBIF](https://www.gbif.org)) sources data from an international network of data providers, known as 'nodes'. Several of these nodes - the [living atlases](https://living-atlases.gbif.org) - maintain their own web services using software originally developed by the Atlas of Living Australia ([ALA](https://www.ala.org.au)). 'galah' enables the R community to directly access data and resources hosted by GBIF and its partner nodes.
