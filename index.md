I am an ecologist and conservation biologist. I study how scientific information can be used to mitigate human impacts on the environment, using two complementary approaches:

- **evidence synthesis:** I study ways to rapidly locate, interpret and synthesize scientific information, using methods from natural language processing and machine learning (see the [revtools R package](https://revtools.net) for more information)
- **empirical ecology:** I use ecological datasets to understand how species respond to natural and human-induced change, and make recommendations for their conservation

In December 2017 I received the Wiley/ESA Next Generation Ecologist Award for my research. I’m currently a research fellow in Professor David Lindenmayer’s lab at the Fenner School of Environment & Society, based at the Australian National University.
