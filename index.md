I am a research fellow at the Australian National University. I study how scientific information can be used to understand human impacts on the environment, and to find ways to mitigate those impacts. I have a particular interest in ways to conserve biodiversity, and to make science more accessible outside of academia. My work is currently focussed on two research fields:

# Applied ecology
I use data from field studies of plants, birds and frogs to study how biodiversity is affected by changes in habitat quality or availability. My PhD investigated the effects of fire on frogs in Booderee National Park (NSW, Australia). More recently, I have studied way to improve biodiversity monitoring and assessment, with the aim of making better recommendations for conservation.

# Evidence synthesis
I study ways to rapidly locate, interpret and synthesize scientific information, using methods from natural language processing and machine learning. As part of this work, I developed the [revtools R package](https://revtools.net) to help scientists quantitatively investigate scientific texts. In December 2017 I received the Next Generation Ecologist Award for my research on evidence synthesis from the Ecological Society of Australia, in partnership with Wiley Publishers. With my colleague Dr Neal Haddaway, I also led the first [Evidence Synthesis Hackathon](https://evidencesynthesishackathon.com) to develop new software for this important field.
