I am a research fellow at the Australian National University. I study how scientific information can be used to understand human impacts on the environment, and to find ways to mitigate those impacts. I have a particular interest in ways to conserve biodiversity, and to make science more accessible outside of academia. My work is currently focussed on two related research fields:

## Evidence synthesis
Evidence synthesis (ES) is the process of summarizing scientific information so that it can be used to solve real problems. This is particularly important in ecology where there are a lot of problems - such as bushfire risk or extinction of threatened species - that are both very urgent, and very difficult to fix. Unfortunately, there is now so much science (an estimated 2 million new articles a year!) that summarizing it is really challenging.

I'm working to develop and test a set of tools to locate, interpret and synthesize scientific information, using methods from natural language processing and machine learning. As part of this work, I developed the [revtools R package](https://revtools.net) to help scientists quantitatively investigate scientific texts. In December 2017 I received the Next Generation Ecologist Award for my research on ES from the Ecological Society of Australia, in partnership with Wiley Publishers. With my colleague Dr Neal Haddaway, I also led the first [Evidence Synthesis Hackathon](https://evidencesynthesishackathon.com) to develop new software for this important field.

## Applied ecology
Broadly speaking, ecology is the study of how plants and animals interact with one another. That sounds very simple until you realise that we all depend on ecosystems for some really important things; like fresh food, air, and water. Applied ecology is a very broad discipline, but I focus on how humans interact with ecosystems, and what the implications are of those interactions for preserving species that are at risk of extinction.

In my research, I use data from field studies of plants, birds and frogs to study how biodiversity is affected by changes in habitat quality or availability. My PhD investigated the effects of fire on frogs in Booderee National Park (NSW, Australia). More recently, I have studied ways to improve biodiversity monitoring and assessment, with the aim of making better recommendations for conservation.
