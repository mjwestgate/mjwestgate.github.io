# About me
I lead the Science & Decision Support Team at the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au). Prior to that I was a Research Fellow in ecology and evidence synthesis at the [Fenner School of Environment & Society](https://fennerschool.anu.edu.au) at the ANU. 

## Scientific programming
I write software for analysing and visualising scientific data, using the R programming language. You can view a selection of my work on the [software](/software.html) page.

## Evidence synthesis
I have a particular interest in ways to conserve biodiversity, and to make science more accessible outside of academia. Evidence synthesis (ES) is the process of summarizing scientific information so that it can be used to solve real problems, but so much science is now being published - an estimated 2 million new articles a year -  that summarizing it is a serious challenge. To help deal with this problem, I co-founded [Evidence Synthesis Hackathon](https://www.eshackathon.org) to develop new software tools for this important field.

## Biodiversity Science
I use data from field studies of plants, birds and frogs to study how biodiversity is affected by disturbances such as fire, or by changes in habitat quality or availability. My PhD investigated the effects of fire on frogs in Booderee National Park (NSW, Australia). You can view a list of my published research papers on the [biodiversity science](/publications.html) page.
