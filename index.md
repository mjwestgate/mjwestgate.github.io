I am a Research Fellow in ecology at the Australian National University, with a strong focus on software development and open science. I study how scientific information can be used to understand human impacts on the environment, and to find ways to mitigate those impacts, work for which I won the ESA/Wiley Next Generation Ecologist Award in 2017. I have a particular interest in ways to conserve biodiversity, and to make science more accessible outside of academia, using methods from two related research fields:

## Evidence synthesis
Evidence synthesis (ES) is the process of summarizing scientific information so that it can be used to solve real problems. Unfortunately, there is now so much science (an estimated 2 million new articles a year) that summarizing it is a serious challenge. To help scientists deal with this problem, I have built new software to locate, interpret and synthesize scientific information, using methods from natural language processing and machine learning. The resulting R package [revtools](https://revtools.net) is listed on CRAN, and is under active development. I also led the recent [Evidence Synthesis Hackathon](https://evidencesynthesishackathon.com) with my colleague Dr Neal Haddaway, to help develop new software tools for this important field.

## Applied ecology
I study on how humans interact with ecosystems, and what the implications are of those interactions for preserving species that are at risk of extinction. More specifically, I use data from field studies of plants, birds and frogs to study how biodiversity is affected by changes in habitat quality or availability. My PhD investigated the effects of fire on frogs in Booderee National Park (NSW, Australia). More recently, I have studied ways to improve biodiversity monitoring and assessment, with the aim of making better recommendations for conservation.
